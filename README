How to compile the project:
	Type 'make'
Example of how to run the project:
	./oss -n 3 -s 2 -t 4.4 -i 0.3
Generative AI: Google Gemini
Prompts:
	I did not use a prompt to build the entire project or
	any entire source file or header file. I did a variety of 
	Google searches on how different functions worked and how 
	particular tasks can be accomplished. Google Gemini provides
	an initial response to any Google query so I utilized it
	to show code snippets that accomplish specific goals such
	as creating shared memory or how to enforce the interval
	of time required between launching child processes.
Summary:
	This tool was very helpful but often yielded results that 
	I could only draw logic from, not direct code. It gathers data
	from sources that include user-uploaded code so a lot of its
	recommendations are overly specific. However, it did allow me
	to figure out how to implement each task required for this
	assignment. It was especially useful in debugging, particularly 
	when running on the opsys server yielded errors that my local
	computer had not.
